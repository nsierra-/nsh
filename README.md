nsh
===

A basic shell. Work in progress. "n" cause my name is No√©.

How to use it ?
---------------
```shell
git clone https://github.com/nsierra-/nsh.git
cd nsh
make
./nsh
```

Warning
-------

Currently, this shell only deals with one command. No redirections, no nothing. I'd REALLY like to work on it more. As soon as I have time. Anyway I feel it's kind of a good starting point. Parser NOT FINISHED. Once again, this is a work in progress, initiated by a school project that is now over.
